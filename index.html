        This is my physics engine. There are many like it, but this one is mine. 
        My physics engine is my best friend. It is my life. 
        I must master it as I must master my life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Without me, my physics engine is useless. Without my physics engine, I am useless.
        I must code my physics engine flawless.
        I must code faster than that random programmer with a youtube channel.
        I must deploy my code before they deploy theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
        My physics engine and I know that what counts in programming is not the lines we write, the size of our arrays, nor the library we use.
        We know that it is the beauty that counts. We will write beautiful code.
        My physics engine is human, even as I am human, because it is my life.
        Thus, I will learn it as a sibling.
        I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its methods, its objects,
        its properties and its events. I will keep my physics engine clean and well-commented,
        even as I am clean and well-commented. We will become part of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
        Before Isaac, I swear this creed. My physics engine and I are the defenders of the laws of motion.
        We are the masters of gravity. We are the detectors of collisions.
        So be it, until victory is ours and there is no console error, but flawless 60fps animations!
